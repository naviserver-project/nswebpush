=======================

Release 0.1

This is a NaviServer module that implements a Web Push Interface
for NaviServer. In essence, this module implements the API functions
to allow a NaviServer based application server to send messages
to a web client via Web Push services (e.g. Google or Mozilla,
depending on the web client), such as Web Push notifications.
These service support asynchronous delivery (in case the client
is currently not online). 

   webpush::send
   webpush::encrypt
   webpush::decrypt   

For more details, see the report.html in the demo directory. So far,
there is no integration with the OpenACS notification API.

Requirements:

- NaviServer (4.99.17 or newer) with the integrated support activated
  (default).
- Tcllib (e.g. 1.15) installed on the Tcl library search path.


Testing:

  Run the following command in the source directory of this module
  
      make test
      
  The test requires a functioning NaviServer installation.
  Three push notifications are sent during testing. To make the 
  respective tests pass set the ::testEndpoint variable at the start 
  of the script to a valid subscription.
  
Installation:

   The default installation installs the nswebpush module into
   /usr/local/ns/tcl/nswebpush and the demo to
   /usr/local/ns/pages/webpush-demo. As for other NaviServer modules,
   the install prefix "/usr/local/ns" can be altered by specifying
   "NAVISERVER=" in the invocation of "make".
   
      make install
      make install-demo

   OpenACS uses different directory directory structures. Therefore,
   one case specify in such cases the install targets in more detail.
   For example, a sample OpenACS installation might use
   
      make MODULEDIR=/var/www/openacs.org/tcl/  install
      make DEMODIR=/var/www/openacs.org/www/    install-demo

Configuration:

   In order to enable the nswebpush module, one has to add
   a section like the following to your NaviServer configuration file.
   
      ns_section ns/server/${server}/modules {
          ns_param nswebpush tcl
      }
      
   To send a push notification the minimal requirements are a private
   key in pem format and a subscription that was registered to the 
   matching public key. A minimal claim just contains a mailto URI
   in the 'sub' field. This field currently must contain a mailto
   otherwise an exception will be thrown.
